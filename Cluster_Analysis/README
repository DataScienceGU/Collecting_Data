See how silhouette score is changing for different parameters. Since my silhouette score is higher
for lower # of clusters, it's bad

I chose features that I thought would be most relevant

extra credit ideas:
    1. use different epsilon values for dbscan?
    2. use different plotting scheme?

Conduct three (3) cluster analyses on your data. Explain your findings.

The AgglomerativeClustering object performs a hierarchical clustering using a bottom up approach: each observation starts in its own cluster, and clusters are successively merged together. The linkage criteria determines the metric used for the merge strategy:

Back to DBSCAN. DBSCAN is a clustering method that is used in machine learning to separate clusters of high density from clusters of low density. Given that DBSCAN is a density based clustering algorithm, it does a great job of seeking areas in the data that have a high density of observations, versus areas of the data that are not very dense with observations.

As the number of clusters increases, hierarchical clustering performance improves.
 If there is noise in the data set, k-means will lead to the lowest quality clusters.
 DBSCAN will handle noise best.
 DBSCAN can find arbitrary shaped clusters better.

Exact silhouette scores for different number of clusters + algorithms are in text files.

Original shooting data:
    Ward: .17 ~ .21
    Kmeans: .22 ~ .25
    DBScan: .1 ~ .3

Extra shooting data:
    Ward: .40 ~ .36
    Kmeans: .40 ~ .44
    DBScan: .55 for everything

Movie data:
    Ward: .19 ~ .33
    Kmeans: .26 ~ .35
    DBScan: .48 ~ .5

The silhouette scores for every clustering algorithm for all our datasets were rather low.

Most of the silhouette scores for Ward and Kmeans were higher for lower number of clusters. This
could be another indicator of why clustering is not suitable for our data. Even a very small 
number for the clusters (3) for a dataset with thousands of entries that should intuitively have
more clusters were seemingly more accurate than larger number of clusters.



Does the plot give you additional insight about the clustering – explain.

Now, see the first and second principal components, we see Northern Ireland a major outlier.

They are all clumped, showing that data is too dispersed/varied for there to be reasonable clusters
to be found
